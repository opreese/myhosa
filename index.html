MyHOSA stands for my hours of service availability.<br><br>
This service is dedicated to America's OTR drivers. God Bless You ALL. Thank you for youir service.<br><br>
My name is Owen Reese. I am an OTR truck driver and my hobby is programming computers.<br>
Im just a young truck driver compared to some of the guys i worked with in the past 12 years. I only have apx 1.5 million miles or so and i still can't back up worth a darn. Yes it is true i still got to GET OUT AND LOOK and hope you guys will do the same.<br>
I love God. I hope you will <a href="http://fbcadcam.com/fbcadcam_about_owen.html">WOEKBYG</a><br>

The idea of this communication service (myhosa.com) is to make a simple way for drivers to communicate meaningful and relevant info to dispatchers and brokers. What information is meaningful and relevant varies from load to load and also varies during to entire process from load procurement to final delivery.<br>

A driver's HOSA (Hours of service availability) completly affects everyone invlolved.
If a driver starts out with a fresh 70,14 and 11 etc... well there's not to much to be concered with. But that's not going to be the case for every load and every situation.r even if the driver starts out with a full 




Most of the time the primary concern a dispatcher / broker has is if the driver is running ON SCHEDULE in order that the delivery will be done ON TIME.


 so you don't need to fill everything outh every time.   HOSA info with dispatchers and brokers. However, the hosa info all by itself is not very useful.  while at the same time  in such a way that is to on time delivery.<br><br>
Why would a driver want to do this?<br>
Cuz you might be able to make more money if the dispatchers / brokers would run you better. You've heard time is money. Your time is valualbleShare your HOSA info so your services might be <br><br>
After u enter your hosa info you will be given a HOSA NUMBER... Write that number down. Give it to your dispatch and your broker. Then they can BOTH see your available hours.<br><br>
Now i know that most of us drivers out here do not know who the broker is UNTIL we get that call... you know what call i'm talking about... the check call.<br>
That's when you tell the broker your myHOSA number.<br>
And the broker is going to say myWHAT?<br><br>
you say... yah i gave myHOSA number to my dispatcher, maybe he didn't give it to you or maybe you forgot to ask him for it...<br><br>
you follow that up with something like, yah you just go to myhosa.com and check myhosa number and you can find out my location anytime you like. and not only that but you can see how many hours i have as well. And as a bonus, how far i got to go to delivery.<br><br>
actually, the part about them being able to check your location anytime they want is not working yet.... but i almost got it figured out. plus i am making it possible for them (the dispatchers / brokers) to know the answere to the question they are really asking. ps they don't really care where you are at as much as they care about how far u got to go.<br>
so what i'm going to do is make a way for you to include the destination zip code of where u are going. adding that little piece of info to your HOSA record makes it possible to aproximate a distance between your gps lattitude / longitude and a zip code.<br>
i got it kinda working at the moment you can check it out at
